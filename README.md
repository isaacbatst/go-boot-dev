## Assignment

At Textio, a "user" struct represents an account holder, and a "sender" is just a "user" with some "sender" specific data. A "sender" is a user that has a rateLimit field that tells us how many messages they are allowed to send.

Fix the system by using an embedded struct as expected by the test code.
