# Boot Dev Go

[Boot.dev Go](boot.dev) is a platform with a go course that aims to learn it by applying language features into little assignments to build Textio - Twilio's little brother.

## Assignment

As an easter egg, we decided to reward our users with a free text message if they send a prime number of text messages this year.

Complete the printPrimes function. It should print all of the prime numbers up to and including max. It should skip any numbers that are not prime.

Here's the pseudocode:

```
printPrimes(max):
  for n in range(2, max+1):
    if n is 2:
      n is prime, print it
    if n is even:
      n is not prime, skip to next n
    for i in range (3, sqrt(n) + 1):
      if i can be multiplied into n:
        n is not prime, skip to next n
    n is prime, print it
```

### BREAKDOWN

We skip even numbers because they can't be prime
We only check up to the square root of n because anything higher than the square root has no chance of multiplying evenly into n
We start checking at 2 because 1 is not prime
